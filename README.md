Destiny-Focus is an app for Destiny the game, helping you focus on improving particular aspects of your playstyle, for PvP, Gambit or Raiding game modes.
Destiny-Focus allows you to choose an area you want to focus on improving, such as your PvP Kill / Death Ratio (K/D R) or your accuracy with a particular weapon type, such as tracking headshots with your favourite sniper.


# Why focus?
Most Destiny players invest a large amount of their lives into the game, espically the competative aspects of the Player-Versus-Player and endgame Player-Versus-Enemy gamemodes. Some times it can be frustrating for players if they feel like they're not improving their game play.

Destiny-Focus gives players graphs, quantified metrics, and goals that allow them to track their improvements, bridging the gap between causal and MLG players.
